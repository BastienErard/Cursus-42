# CPP Modules - 42 School

Welcome to the CPP Modules project, part of the 42 curriculum, designed to introduce students to the basics and advanced concepts of C++ programming. This project is divided into 9 distinct modules, each focusing on different aspects of the language and its practical applications.

## Project Overview

The CPP Modules project consists of a series of exercises that gradually increase in complexity. Each module is designed to teach specific aspects of C++, starting from the basics and moving towards more complex subjects like object-oriented programming, templates, and exceptions.

## Modules Description

- **Module 00**: Introduction to C++, basics of making classes and instances.
- **Module 01**: Memory allocation, references, pointers to members.
- **Module 02**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overload, and canonical classes.
- **Module 03**: Inheritance.
- **Module 04**: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.
- **Module 05**: Exception handling.
- **Module 06**: C++ casts.
- **Module 07**: C++ templates.
- **Module 08**: Templated containers, iterators, and algorithms.

## Installation

To compile and run the exercises from each module, you will need:
- A C++ compiler supporting C++98 or later (g++, clang++).
- Make build system.

### Clone and Compile

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BastienErard/Cursus-42.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the any module directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Cursus-42/11\ -\ CPP/....
   ```

3. **Compile the project:**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

This will generate the executable files for the exercises in the module.

## Usage

To run an exercise, simply execute the compiled binary:

   ```bash
   ./exercise_name
   ```

   Replace `exercise_name` with the actual name of the binary you wish to run.

## Contributing
