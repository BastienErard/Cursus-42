# Cursus 42

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the 42 School Cursus projects. This repository contains a collection of projects designed to challenge students across a variety of computer science disciplines, from software programming and system administration to network programming and graphics.

## Curriculum Overview

The 42 Cursus is designed to develop a student's skills in problem-solving, coding, and collaboration through hands-on projects. These projects increase in complexity and scope, starting from basic scripts to complex programs and systems.

## Projects

Below is a brief overview of each main project within the curriculum, organized by the skills they aim to develop and the technologies they employ.

### Programming Fundamentals

- **Libft**: Reimplementation of various standard C library functions.
- **Get Next Line**: Function to read content line by line from a file descriptor.
- **Printf**: Reimplementation of the `printf` function from the C standard library.

### System Programming

- **Born2beRoot**: A system administration project focused on setting up a secure virtual server with strict service requirements.
- **Minishell**: Creation of a simple shell.
- **Philosophers**: Solving the dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes.

### Algorithms and AI

- **Push_Swap**: Sorting algorithm project that involves sorting data with a limited set of operations and stacks.

### Graphics

- **Fdf**: Wireframe representation of a 3D landscape.
- **Cub3D**: Raycasting engine inspired by the game "Wolfenstein 3D".

### Web Development

- **Webserv**: HTTP server written in C++ complying with the HTTP/1.1 standard.
- **Transcendence**: Web application featuring multiplayer games with a web interface.

### Network Programming

- **NetPractice**: Series of network programming challenges.
- **Minitalk**: A small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

### C++ Modules

- **CPP Modules**: Series of projects to introduce students to C++, covering topics from basic syntax to advanced concepts like templates and STL.

### Virtualization and Containerization

- **Inception**: Project focusing on containerization and orchestration using Docker and Docker-compose to create a web service architecture.

## Installation and Usage

Each project directory includes specific instructions on how to compile and run the programs.
